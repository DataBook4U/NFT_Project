972,2022-12-08 18:00:52+00:00,opensea,"16/ Additionally, we’ve heard compelling pushback from creators on the lack of an alternative mechanism for earning creator fees on OpenSea outside of leveraging our enforcement tool."

- Open, transparent governance of the existing Operator Filter registry and the policies that surround it

Our first step towards a better v2 is to decentralize management and governance of the registry — initially, by granting control of it to CORI."
985,2022-12-08 18:00:48+00:00,opensea,"3/ It’s an existential imperative for the space to preserve creator fees. Recently, OpenSea took a step intended to protect them by releasing an on-chain enforcement tool called the Operator Filter."

1061,2022-12-01 22:15:50+00:00,opensea,"4/ For those wondering why these chains have until Jan 2, 2023: while our enforcement is already live on Ethereum, the reality is that these chains simply don’t have fee-evading marketplaces."
1062,2022-12-01 22:15:49+00:00,opensea,"3/ Our policy is that creator fees will be enforced for *all* projects that launch on these chains before Jan 2, 2023.

After that, projects on non-Ethereum EVM chains (see those listed above) will need to use the operator filter to have their fees enforced."

1068,2022-12-01 18:10:27+00:00,opensea,"4/ We’re excited to also be adding tagging so projects can make themselves unique within categories!

But we have a 2 part criteria for removal from our filter list – if Blur commits to protecting creator fees for existing collections we’ll remove them.

1417,2022-11-06 02:44:39+00:00,opensea,@elliotrades @PlayImpostors We're working to build (at least the beginnings of) a set of options that take the range of creators and their circumstances into account. Our DMs are open and we want to keep hearing from you about this.
1418,2022-11-06 02:34:49+00:00,opensea,"@_jeffnicholas_ @betty_nft We agree with you, they should, and that’s why we’re working to build multiple paths forward for creator fee enforcement that serves the vast spectrum of creators and projects for the long term."
1419,2022-11-06 02:24:18+00:00,opensea,@amber_vittoria @WWMLD We did record it! And it is the beginning of the conversation. By December 8th we want to have (at least the beginnings of) a set of options that take the range of creators and their circumstances into account. We’d really love to be in dialogue with you about this.
1420,2022-11-06 02:12:58+00:00,opensea,@Fitchinverse Thanks for sharing your perspective 🤝
1421,2022-11-06 02:09:48+00:00,opensea,"@pranksy Thanks for the kind words, our DMs are open and we’d love to hear your perspective 🤝"
1422,2022-11-06 02:07:21+00:00,opensea,"Thanks for those who spent some of their Saturday nights with us just now. We’ll be hosting more Spaces over the next couple days that’ll include open Q&amp;As.

We *absolutely* want to hear from all of you on this and will take care to create a forum to do so (on a weekday)."
1423,2022-11-06 02:02:57+00:00,opensea,"@betty_nft We hear you, and voices like yours are exactly the ones we're actively considering and in dialogue with. Not all creators are the same, and we know that will still be true after Dec 8."

Please join @dfinzer @SteveyTrommm @AnnieFauv &amp; @NadavAHollander in Spaces starting shortly."
1427,2022-11-06 00:55:11+00:00,opensea,"9/ There is SO MUCH more to discuss when it comes to a topic this important. We know it's long, but we tried to include as much valuable information as possible around our thought process and open questions here: https://t.co/wK3Yp4dyto"
1428,2022-11-06 00:55:11+00:00,opensea,"8/ We recognize not all creators, collections, and communities are the same and we are looking to create a long-term policy that reflects that."
1429,2022-11-06 00:55:10+00:00,opensea,"7/ In transparency, the consideration set for what happens after Dec 8 is wide open – w/ options ranging from continuing to enforce off-chain fees for some subsets of collections to allowing optional creator fees to collaborating on other on-chain enforcement options for creators"
1430,2022-11-06 00:55:10+00:00,opensea,"6/ Knowing how difficult it is to enforce fees on-chain for existing collections, we won’t make any changes for existing collections until at least Dec 8, 2022. In the meantime, we'll hold conversations w/ our communities to get their POV on a more optimal outcome"
1431,2022-11-06 00:55:10+00:00,opensea,"5/ We recognize this is a first step that addresses new collections, but we also know how important it is to think about alternatives to help existing collections navigate this new ecosystem dynamic."
1432,2022-11-06 00:55:09+00:00,opensea,"4/ This tool is our first version of on-chain enforcement, and in the coming months we’ll launch additional tools and improvements for on-chain enforcement of new collections, and we’ll engage with the community to get feedback on them along the way."
1433,2022-11-06 00:55:09+00:00,opensea,3/ To that end today we’re launching a tool for on-chain enforcement of creator fees for *new collections*  Starting 12pm ET on Tuesday Nov 8 OpenSea will enforce creator fees only for new collections that use an on-chain enforcement tool such as this one. https://t.co/i0PMdt5HiV
1434,2022-11-06 00:55:09+00:00,opensea,"2/ It’s clear that many creators want the ability to enforce fees on-chain &amp; we believe that choice should be theirs–not a marketplace’s–to make.  

So we’re building tools we hope will balance the scales by putting more power in creators’ hands to control their business model."
1435,2022-11-06 00:55:08+00:00,opensea,"There’s been a lot of discussion over the past few months about business models for NFT creators &amp; whether creator fees (“royalties”) are viable. 

Given our role in the ecosystem, we want to take a thoughtful, principled approach to this topic &amp; to lead w/ solutions. 🧵"

1475,2022-11-02 15:32:00+00:00,opensea,"6/ Items involved in detected suspicious behavior will be temporarily disabled on OpenSea, and the previous owner will immediately be notified via email. The previous owner can then share feedback with us to reinstate the item and enable it to be sold again."

2787,2022-08-10 22:02:23+00:00,opensea,4/ So why do we have this policy? It is against US law to knowingly allow the sale and transfer of stolen items. We do not want to incentivize theft by allowing our platform to be used to help sell stolen items.

2927,2022-07-11 20:08:20+00:00,opensea,P.S. Take a close look at the front page of the newspaper… there might be something fun for the first 50 people to show their art skills.
2928,2022-07-11 20:08:20+00:00,opensea,“Good luck minting your Key Card. Which tower will you get —and what will happen there? You’ll find out soon. Stay tuned at https://t.co/u9mMPx4sC0.”
2929,2022-07-11 20:08:20+00:00,opensea,"“KINGSHIP currently resides on the island where they first met Arnell. They are in the process of building four towers, one for each member of the band; each with its own unique properties and powers.”"
2930,2022-07-11 20:08:19+00:00,opensea,"“KING began sharing vocal duty in the band with Hud and Captain. To this day, it is a matter of some dispute and controversy whether KING was the actual King of Solana or not. What is agreed by everyone is that KING rules the swamp as the singer and front-Ape of KINGSHIP.”"
2931,2022-07-11 20:08:19+00:00,opensea,"“She bridged the former King of Solana, now known as KING, to the Ethereum blockchain, using an artist visa. The plan was for KING to pretend that he was a member of the band, but it turned out he had serious talent.”"
2932,2022-07-11 20:08:19+00:00,opensea,"“Through Arnell’s connections, they began to build a small following and attracted the attention of the legendary Manager Noët All. At the time, Manager Noët All was doing volunteer work, helping Apes escape from the great gas war.”"
2933,2022-07-11 20:08:19+00:00,opensea,"“Naming themselves Darkship, they spent years struggling, shuffling through singers, and playing at dive bars in the swamp. After performing at an island party, they met Arnell, a Mutant DJ. Hitting it off immediately, they convinced her to produce and eventually join the band.”"
2934,2022-07-11 20:08:18+00:00,opensea,"“Life on the Ethereum blockchain isn’t easy. You can’t just change your traits. You’re stuck with them for life. Bonded by the belief that great music brings every species together and transcends traits and rarity, they formed a band soon after.”"
2935,2022-07-11 20:08:18+00:00,opensea,"“They first came together many blocks ago in high school where lead guitarist Hud was an outsider because his laser eyes were a clichéd trait. Another freshman, Captain (bass), who’d learned to be tough early on bc his traits clashed, stuck up for him and a friendship was formed”"
2936,2022-07-11 20:08:18+00:00,opensea,"“KINGSHIP is the first supergroup of Apes signed to a major label. They are known for their multi-Ethereum-selling music, their unique blend of boredom, and their island kingdom.”"
